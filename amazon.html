                <h1>Amazon.sg</h1>
                <p>Amazon.com is an international e-commerce company and the leading e-retailer in the United States,
                    with net sales amounting to close to 386 billion U.S. dollars in 2020. As a worldwide e-commerce
                    company, Amazon operates in 13 countries and ships worldwide to more than 100 countries. Due to its
                    global scope and reach, Amazon is considered one of the most valuable brands worldwide.</p>

                    <p>Though Amazon is the largest online retailer in the world, it ranks only 3rd in Singapore with
                        Shopee leading at 13.6 million visits as of the 2nd quarter of 2021, followed by Lazada at 7.5
                        million while Amazon at 6.5 million (Statista, 2021).

                        However, I believe Amazon has the potential to strive in Singapore as well by redesigning its
                        mobile application

            <li>With the rising consumer spending, government support and growing preference for online shopping,
                Singapore e-commerce market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16.2% through 2025
                to be worth $14.2b, according to GlobalData. </li>

            <li>73% of online consumers in Singapore have patronized overseas merchants. Presently, cross-border
                e-commerce takes 35% of the entire Singapore e-commerce market (Heysara PteLtd, 2021).</li>

            <li>In 2021, Singapore’s user penetration is expected to be 55.9% and should reach 67.2% by 2025. The
                average revenue per user (ARPU) is also expected to reach USD 846.96 by 2025.</li>

            <li>According to a study by performance marketing firm Reprise Digital, Singaporean shoppers are very
                price-conscious, with 63% of consumers choosing to shop online for promotions and discounts. In fact,
                52% of Singaporean shoppers do their due diligence by visiting brand websites before making a purchase

                <p>
                    To compare Amazon with its stronger competitors, I did a competitor analysis in which these insights
                    gained will provide key information in terms of the strengths we want to build upon and the
                    weaknesses we want to avoid.
