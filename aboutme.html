                    I'm Wei Zhen
                </h1>
                <h3>
                    I'm an aspiring product designer based in Singapore. I'm passionate about creating an impactful and
                    meaningful user experience through design.
                    With my experiences in business and marketing, I am able to see through the lenses of users as well
                    as businesses and empathise with them.
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    Drive . Commitment . Gratitude .
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    I hold these values dearly to my heart. That burning passion in me provides clarity in my purposes.
                    Cultivating a habit is what keeps me committed to my goals. And gratitude is a reminder for me to
                    appreciate the little things in life. </h3>

                    What got me into product design?
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    As an economics undergraduate, I learn to draw quantitative insights from a pool of data which
                    brushes my numerical, analytical and problem-solving skills. It helps me to think strategically and
                    make decisions to optimise the outcome. I got the opportunity to apply such soft skills during my
                    marketing internships.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    While I was interning in Shopee Singapore, I got lots of exposure in website design and wireframe
                    creations as I was tasked to design thematic microsites such as cameras, video games and home
                    appliances microsites. Often, I find myself enjoying that freedom to unleash my creativity through
                    design. While doing my post-campaign analysis, I learnt how designs play a significant role in
                    bounce rate, traffic and consumer retention.

                    Challenges Ahead
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    I wanted to deploy my 1st project on a website to showcase it to potential users to get feedback. I
                    started off using Webflow, a website building software with no coding experience needed. However,
                    halfway through, it turned out I had to pay a fee to continue deploying it.
                </h3>
                <h3>
                    As adventurous as I can be, I challenged myself to pick up HTML and CSS to code out my own website
                    just to avoid paying that fee which brings me to where I am today.
                </h3>
                <h2>
                    TLDR
                </h2>
                <h3>
                    It's been a long journey thus far but Iâ€™ve never regretted any of the choices made. My past
                    experiences have equipped me with transferable skills and that accumulation of skills and
                    experiences have moulded me into who I am today. </h3>
